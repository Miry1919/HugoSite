«“Nature” is what we see—
&nbsp;

The Hill—the Afternoon—
&nbsp;

Squirrel—Eclipse—the Bumble bee—
&nbsp;

Nay—Nature is Heaven—
&nbsp;

Nature is what we hear—
&nbsp;

The Bobolink—the Sea—
&nbsp;

Thunder—the Cricket—
&nbsp;

Nay—Nature is Harmony—
&nbsp;

Nature is what we know—
&nbsp;

Yet have no art to say—
&nbsp;

So impotent Our Wisdom is
&nbsp;

To her Simplicity.»

«I’m nobody! Who are you?
&nbsp;

Are you nobody, too?
&nbsp;

Then there’s a pair of us — don’t tell!
&nbsp;

They’d banish us, you know.
&nbsp;

How dreary to be somebody!
&nbsp;

How public, like a frog
&nbsp;

To tell your name the livelong day
&nbsp;

To an admiring bog!»

«Success is counted sweetest
&nbsp;

By those who ne’er succeed.»

«Faith is a fine invention
&nbsp;

For gentlemen who see;
&nbsp;

But microscopes are prudent
&nbsp;

In an emergency!»

«That Love is all there is,
&nbsp;

Is all we know of Love;
&nbsp;

It is enough, the freight should be
&nbsp;

Proportioned to the groove.»
