«Complexity is the worst enemy of security. The more complex a system is, the less secure it is. And our billions of computers, each with their tens of millions of lines of code, connected into the Internet, with its trillions of webpages and unknown zettabytes of data—comprise the most complex machine humankind has ever built.»

«Education is hard. We need to educate people that security matters and how to make security choices, without necessarily turning them into security engineers. These are technical issues, yet we don't want to create a world where only technical experts are guaranteed security. That's where we are right now with our laptops and home networks. The complexity of these systems is beyond the understanding of average consumers. You have to be an expert to configure them, so most people don't bother. We have to do better.»

«We are forced to trust everyone whose products and services we use. Try to understand who you are trusting and to what degree, and make those trust decisions as intelligently as possible. Make you decisions about the cloud, the Internet of Things, and everything else with as much knowledge and forethought as you can.»

«Human beings operate on trust. No other species trusts at anywhere near the scale we do. Society would collapse without trust; indeed, society would have never formed without it.»
